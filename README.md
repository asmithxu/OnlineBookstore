## ** Part 1: Category Filter Button**
 - Add the javascript code the category buttons so that, when clicked only the books for that category are displayed on the page



4. **For-Loops**  
   - Loops through collections such as HTMLCollections. Unlike arrays, HTMLCollections don’t have array methods like `forEach()`, so a `for` loop is needed to iterate over them.
